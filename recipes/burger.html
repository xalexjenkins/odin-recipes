    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a very quick delicious burger recipe for anyone who wants to make some delicious patties at home for their family. Minimal ingredients and short cook time</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of ground beef (80/20)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 roma tomato</li>
        <li>Iceberg Lettuce</li>
        <li>Buns of course!</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix up the ground beef into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the egg into the ground beef; this helps it keep its shape and not break.</li>
        <li>Form the patties into circular shapes. Be sure to keep them flat for an even cook. You can also put a thumb print in the center to help keep juices in</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper 1 side of the patty before putting it on the grill</li>
        <li>Put the patties on the grill; 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Cut up the roma tomato into thin slices, not thicker than your patties.</li>
        <li>Break off some pieces of lettuce for some crunch</li>
        <li>Once you flip the burgers apply salt and pepper to the other side of the burger</li>
        <li>Toast some buns either on the grill or with a toaster</li>
        <li>Once the burgers are done let them sit for a minute to soak up juices again</li>
        <li>Assemble your burger and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Other tips!</h3>
    <p>Some other stuff you can do is spice it up with some other ingredients. I Like onions and pickles but my wife doesnt. You can also get some cheese and put it on about 2 minutes before the burger is done and let it melt to one side! Enjoy!</p>
